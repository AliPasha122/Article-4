Despite the rapid advancements in science and technology, electronic waste (e-waste)
management at the household level remains an unresolved challenge. The exponential
growth of personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and smart
home systems has led to a significant accumulation of obsolete or non-functional gadgets.
These often end up in landfills, causing severe environmental hazards due to the toxic metals
and chemicals they contain.I propose the development of community-based smart e-waste collection stations equipped
with AI-driven sorting and categorization technology. These stations would be strategically
placed in urban and suburban neighborhoods to make e-waste disposal as easy as throwing
out household garbage.
